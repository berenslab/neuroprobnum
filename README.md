# neuroprobnum
Probabilistic numerics for common neuroscience models.

# Content by directories
## experiments
Contains all the notebooks to create figures.

## generator
Contains python files to conventiently generate data for all the model with different solvers.

## models
Contains all implemented models in python and cython.

## solver
Contains the imlemented probabilistic and deterministic solvers.

## utils
Contains several python files that are used across the different notebooks.
The most used file is "plot_utils.py", which is used to create consistent figures across the notebooks.
